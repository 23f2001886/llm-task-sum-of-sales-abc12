# Sum of Sales

This project is a simple static web application that sums sales data from a CSV file and displays the total on the webpage.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that fetches the CSV data, processes it, and updates the total sales on the page.
- `data.csv`: The CSV file containing sales data (not provided here).

## Usage
1. Place the `data.csv` file in the same directory as `index.html` and `script.js`.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the total sales.
