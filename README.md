# Sum of Sales

This project is a simple static web application that sums sales from a CSV file and displays the total on the page.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the total sales.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that fetches the CSV data and calculates the total sales.

## Usage
1. Place the `data.csv` file in the same directory as the other files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the total sales.

## Data Format
The `data.csv` file should have sales data in the following format:
```
item,sale
item1,100
item2,200
```
